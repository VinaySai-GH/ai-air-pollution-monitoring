🌍 Air Pollution Monitoring and Tracking
Monitoring

The primary focus of this project is air pollution monitoring, which involves continuously collecting and analyzing air quality data from multiple real-world sources. The system monitors key pollutants such as PM2.5, NO₂, SO₂, and CO using a combination of ground-based stations and satellite observations.

Monitoring enables:

Understanding current air quality conditions

Identifying pollution-prone regions

Visualizing spatial and temporal pollution patterns

Tracking of Pollutant Movement

In addition to monitoring, the system provides a basic form of pollutant tracking.

Pollutant tracking in this project refers to:

Observing how pollution levels change across locations over time

Estimating the direction of pollution spread using wind speed and wind direction data

Identifying how polluted air masses may affect nearby regions

This is achieved by combining:

Time-varying pollution concentration data

Meteorological parameters such as wind speed and direction (ERA5)

The tracking is conceptual and directional, focusing on pollution transport at a regional scale rather than precise particle-level movement.

Scope Clarification

This system does not attempt to simulate detailed atmospheric chemistry or physical dispersion models. Instead, it provides a simplified, explainable, and visualization-driven approach suitable for awareness, planning, and academic analysis.

🔍 How This Differs from Traditional Monitoring Systems
Aspect	Traditional Systems	Proposed System
Data sources	Only ground stations	Ground + satellite data
Spatial coverage	Limited to sensor locations	Large-area regional coverage
Real-time visualization	Limited or static	Interactive web-based maps
Tracking capability	Mostly static readings	Time-based pollution movement analysis
Decision support	Reactive	More proactive and data-driven
Accessibility	Often technical	Public-friendly visualization

Traditional air quality systems mainly provide point-based measurements, whereas this project enhances monitoring by offering spatial context, trend analysis, and basic movement tracking using AI and cloud-based tools.

🌱 Social Relevance

By extending traditional monitoring with tracking and visualization, the system helps:

Raise public awareness about pollution spread

Identify regions indirectly affected by pollution

Support data-informed environmental and health decisions
