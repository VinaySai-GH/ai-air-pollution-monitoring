**🌍 AI & Cloud-Based Air Pollution Monitoring System**
**📌 Overview**

This project builds a simple AI and cloud-based system to monitor air pollution using real satellite and ground-level data.
The system analyzes air quality, identifies pollution hotspots, and visualizes results on an interactive web dashboard.
It is developed as a socially relevant project under NSS.

**🎯 Objectives**

Monitor air pollution using real-world data

Analyze PM2.5, NO₂, SO₂, and CO

Identify pollution hotspots using machine learning

Provide basic tracking of pollution movement using wind data

Make air quality information easy to understand through maps and a chatbot

**📊 Data Sources**

Ground AQI & PM2.5: OpenAQ (CPCB stations)

Satellite pollutants: Sentinel-5P (NO₂, SO₂, CO)

Weather data: ERA5 (wind speed, temperature)

Cloud platform: Google Earth Engine

**🧠 Technologies Used**

Python, Pandas, NumPy

Machine Learning: Random Forest, K-Means (scikit-learn)

Backend: FastAPI

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Maps & Charts: Mapbox, Chart.js

Cloud services: GEE, OpenAQ, Mapbox

**🌬️ Monitoring & Tracking**

The system continuously monitors air pollution levels and provides basic tracking of pollutant movement by analyzing how pollution changes over time and aligns with wind direction.
This helps understand how polluted air spreads across nearby regions.

**💬 AI Chat Assistant**

A simple AI-powered chatbot helps users:

Understand terms like PM2.5 and AQI

Interpret pollution maps and hotspots

Get basic air-quality related guidance

**🔍 How This Differs from Traditional Systems**

Traditional systems mainly show static readings at sensor locations.
This project enhances monitoring by combining satellite + ground data, adding AI-based analysis, basic pollution movement tracking, and interactive visualization.
**🌱 Social Relevance (NSS)**

The project promotes air-quality awareness, supports data-driven environmental understanding, and demonstrates ethical use of AI for public good.
